# Task 1:  
1.1 Create an array with N = 1000 elements and fill it with random integers from -2000 to 2000.  
1.2 Write a function for sorting using the "bubble sort" algorithm, and sort the array in ascending order.  
1.3 Write a function for linear search in the array, which returns the index of the found element or -1 if the element is not found.  
1.4 Write a function for binary search in the array, which returns the index of the found element or -1 if the element is not found.  
1.5 Compare the performance of the search algorithms (search for random numbers in the array from -2000 to 2000), test the correctness of the algorithms.  

# Task 2:  
2.1 Create an array with N = 200 elements and fill it with consecutive numbers from 1 to N.  
2.2 Write a function to shuffle the array using the Fisher-Yates algorithm and shuffle the array.  
2.3 Sort the array using insertion sort based on the criterion of the last digit in ascending order (e.g., 72 < 23, since 2 < 3), in case of a tie - smaller values come first.  

# Task 3:  
Implement the algorithm for ternary search or golden section search to find the minimum of the mathematical function f(x) = x^2 + ax + b on the interval [-100, 100] (variables a, b are entered from the keyboard).
